# Thesis Description
The objective of this work is to build accurate forecasts for the price of energy in the Iberian market. Good forecasts allow companies to make better decisions at the business level. To achieve this goal, I collected data which is relevant to develop forecasting models under an econometric framework.
The present work used the ARIMA and ARIMAX models to obtain forecasts. The Box-Jenkins methodology was used as a reference for the model building process. I used the R software to perform data analysis, time series modelling and compute the forecasts for the variable of interest.
I find that the ARIMAX models performed better than the ARIMA models in predicting the price of energy.
